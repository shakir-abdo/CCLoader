### General

### Replacing Stock Control Center Sections

Stock Control Center sections can also be replaced with a custom bundle. The NIC template will ask you for which section ID should be replaced. The Section IDs that can be replaced with CCLoader are:
<br>
<br>
• com.apple.controlcenter.settings<br>
• com.apple.controlcenter.brightness<br>
• com.apple.controlcenter.media-controls<br>
• com.apple.controlcenter.air-stuff<br>
• com.apple.controlcenter.quick-launch<br>
<br>
CCLoader checks for `CCReplacingStockSectionID` in the bundle's Info.plist file. if any of the above values is given for that key then the corresponding stock section will be replaced. Otherwise the bundle will be recognized as a new section for Control Center.
<br>
<br>
A custom section that replaced a stock section has two options regarding the sections height: The custom section can return `CGFLOAT_MIN` as `sectionHeight`, in that case the height of the section that is replaced will be used. If the custom section returns anything other than `CGFLOAT_MIN` then that height will be used. This functionality is limited to iPone/iPod touch and to portrait mode. In landscape or on an iPad the height of the section that is being replaced will be used.
<br>
<br>
### iPad Support

The only feature that works on iPads is to replace stock sections. New sections cannot be added to the iPad's Control Center (as of now).
